# Retriever
##### A ~~good doggy~~ simple CLI tool to fetch the news headlines for you. Arf!

Still in development!

The fully ~~trained~~ developed Retriever will, when provided with a NewsAPI key, return the headlines of the day to you, tailored to your preferences.

Still lots of work to be done on both the code and the terrible dog jokes. Sorry.
